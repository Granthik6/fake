# Problem Statement : Fleet and Driver Operations Management System.

## Problem Statement Overview

The Fleet and Driver Operations Management System is designed to improve and automate logistics and delivery operations by managing vehicles, drivers, shipments, and delivery processes through a single centralized platform.

In many logistics environments, activities such as driver assignment, vehicle tracking, shipment preparation, compliance monitoring, and delivery confirmation are often handled manually or across multiple disconnected systems. This leads to delays, lack of real‑time visibility, coordination issues between teams, and higher chances of operational errors.

## Proposed Solution

This system helps solve these problems by providing:

- Centralized management of fleet vehicles and drivers  
- Automated delivery planning and dispatch process  
- Real-time delivery tracking and monitoring  
- Driver and vehicle compliance validation  
- Better coordination between warehouse and dispatch teams  
- Customer delivery tracking and confirmation  
- Support for handling delivery delays, incidents, and reassignment  

### Primary Goal

The main goal is to create a smooth end-to-end logistics workflow from order dispatch to final delivery confirmation while improving efficiency and reducing manual work.
